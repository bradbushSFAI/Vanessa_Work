            7. As a part of our series about "Why We Need More Women Founders", I had the pleasure of interviewing Alice DiSanto.
           
            8. Alice DiSanto is the Vice President of Global Marketing at the Rajant Corporation. Her public and media relations efforts, as well as her work with Rajant's sales team, staff, strategic partners, and channel, focused on business development with a prioritization on voice-of-customer insights. DiSanto is the current chair of the Security Industry Association (SIA)'s Women in Security Forum (WISF), a community whose mission is to engage all security professionals to promote, recruit, and cultivate the leadership of women.

            10. **Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your "backstory"? What led you to this particular career path?**
           
            11. Wall Street, the movie starring Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, and Daryl Hannah, was the rage during my college graduation year, and I too, was lured by the promise of a career in finance. Taking my first gig in a brokerage house, I was studying for the Series 7 securities exam when the "Black Monday" stock market crash hit. Talk about an abrupt mindset upheaval. Fortunately, Toyota Motor Sales had gotten my resume from the university's college recruitment office, and they cold called me serendipitously around the same time. The automotive industry was particularly interested in attracting more women, yet I was skeptical. What I knew of cars and trucks was what my dad insisted I learn before I got my driver's license — how to jump-start an engine, drive a stick shift, and change a tire. Surprisingly, these three skills were golden when sealing my new job in "high tech," where I achieved multi-year national recognition as a top Toyota salesperson. It didn't hurt that my first car was a Toyota, so I came in as a fan of the technology and customer service.
           
            12. **Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?**
           
            13. Cars are seductive and personal, which brought many brushes with fame over the years, with celebrities entrenched in the passion for vehicles. Most memorable was meeting Jerry Seinfeld. One of my favorite automotive dealers was Potamkin Toyota/VW in Manhattan, and I became friends with the staff. They were always looking to fix me up with someone, so when they found out Jerry had his VW in for servicing, they said we had to meet. Making my way to the garage, I was met by the man himself wearing his classic button-down shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers. He was with a fellow comedian pal and could not have been more cordial. We chatted for quite a while, and as we parted, his friend backhanded him, saying, "I told you, Jerry. You should have bought a Toyota."
           
            14. **Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?**
           
            15. Let's say I didn't know about Lombardi Time. Being on time was my jam, but early? I developed discipline from the beginning to work out and "check the box" for my fitness so as not to let the day run me, leaving little time for 15 minutes in the company's favor. I'd get called on it by the higher-ups with snarky comments, but none of my male peers could relate, given they didn't have the demands of dressing the part. There was no business casual where, even in the summer heat, my work attire had to include pantyhose, full makeup, and a polished hairstyle. Not until I confided in another woman, who ended up being a mentor and dear friend, did I get the coaching I needed to overcome the stigma and learn to balance my life to start the workday a little earlier. This practice made me stress less and better prepare my mindset.
           
            16. **None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?**
           
            17. I've been blessed with angels on earth, personally and professionally. In my career, these individuals have proactively paid me attention when I had my head down doing the work, thinking no one was watching. I now wish to recognize Joe Rickard, President of Intellective Solutions. His esteemed career, which included his tenure at Sharp as a Division President, became our throughline. We met when he was a consultant while I worked for a direct marketing agency. My marketing acumen and work ethic made an impression, so when Sharp reached out for his recommendation for a marketing director to oversee its upstart US robotics division, the only name Joe gave them was mine. At that crossroads of my career, I had been out of technology since Toyota. Going back to high tech to work with robots and the security industry, which was Sharp's target market, thrilled me and I've never looked back.
           
            18. **Is there a particular book that made a significant impact on you? Can you share a story or explain why it resonated with you so much?**
           
            19. The Go-Giver by Bob Burg resonates with my professional mission statement to provide "good work" and do "good works". In my experience, giving is the greatest reward. Moreover, what sets this book apart in my memory is that my oldest son recommended it. As he filled his mind and spirit while establishing his own business, The Go-Giver spoke loudly to him and wished to share the power of its five laws: value, compensation, influence, authenticity, and receptivity. These five laws are now foundational to his work, which means the world to me as his mom.
           
            20. **Do you have a favorite "Life Lesson Quote"? Do you have a story about how that was relevant in your life or your work?**
           
            21. Have you heard the adage, if you want something done, ask the busiest person you know to do it? I'm that busy person. It's no secret. The quote reflective of knowing one's self is on my bedstand, and it reads, "My candle burns at both ends; It will not last the night; But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends — It gives a lovely light!" (Edna St. Vincent Millay)
           
            22. **How have you used your success to make the world a better place?**
           
            23. I hope so. Giving is the greatest gift to self. Therefore, I volunteer. What began as a child culminated in lifelong community service. Sometimes, the community was school. Sometimes, the community was the town. Sometimes, the community is the company. Now, my community includes the trade group of the Security Association and its Women in Security Forum, for which I was a founding member in 2018 and now serve as chair. The focus of the Forum is for women to have a bolder presence within the male-dominated security industry.
           
            24. ---
           
            25. **Ok, thank you for that. Let's now jump to the primary focus of our interview. According to this EY report, only about 20 percent of funded companies have women founders. This reflects great historical progress, but it also shows that more work still has to be done to empower women to create companies. In your opinion and experience what is currently holding back women from founding companies?**
           
            26. A seat at the table. I've mentioned two times when the numbers were not stacked in my favor, being a woman — in the late 80s, in the automotive industry, and today, in the security industry. There are innumerable industries where the female/male ratios are skewed, thus suppressing the odds of company-creation success. Quite simply, women lack female mentors and role models. Therefore, they may not believe in the viability of entrepreneurship. Making connections with men is not impossible, and fabulous examples of male allyship abound. Still, we lack a "like-attracting-like" compulsion that propels us beyond the risks of upstarts and the confidence gap necessary to sustain when times get trying.
           
            27. **Can you share with our readers what you are doing to help empower women to become founders?**
           
            28. There is power to empower in numbers. The collective membership of the women and men within SIA's Women in Security Forum is doing tremendous work for founders. Within our nine subcommittees, one is responsible for shepherding women-owned businesses and matchmaking for those interested in pursuing entrepreneurial pathways within security, known as StrengthenHER, co-chaired by two remarkable female business owners. We also have a unique subcommittee, PropelHER, responsible for the feeder program of collegiate and professional female athletes into the security industry. The focus is to open the funnel of career possibilities for these women far beyond the courts, tracks, and fields. They are warriors who can serve the industry well.
           
            29. **This might be intuitive to you but I think it will be helpful to spell this out. Can you share a few reasons why more women should become founders?**
           
            30. Women are revenue builders, and our vantage point is different from men. We recognize and solve problems often overlooked by our male counterparts. This is especially true in the areas of consumer-based products and services. Starting there, we can create a domino effect with wide-eyed possibilities for seeing the numbers of women within the ranks to aspire in their trail. In a world where more women can become founders, businesses gain diversity, innovation, and resilience, ultimately leading to a more robust, inclusive global economy.
           
            31. **Can you please share 5 things that can be done or should be done to help empower more women to become founders?**
           
            32. Change requires looking at the entire person. Women are different creatures, so it's not all business.
           
            33. 1. Formalizing mentorship and networking opportunities.
                2. 2. Creating more pathways to funding.
                   3. 3. Driving greater awareness, training and education.
                      4. 4. Breaking down barriers to entry.
                         5. 5. Building more allyship models to foster collaboration.
                           
                            6. **You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good for the greatest number of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger.**
                           
                            7. It's not about if but when, and I believe groups like the Security Industry Association's Women in Security Forum (WISF) are driving change. I want other industries to contact us for best practices and lessons learned so that we might share our experiences with more groups, such as WISF. Since its inception, WISF has grown to 1,500+ female and male members, with many of whom are active volunteers. WISF leadership hardwires new members into purpose-built subcommittees focused on the topics this interview touches upon. Beyond the ones previously mentioned, WISF subcommittees also include regionalized recruitment, an annual education conference, an endowment fund, charitable community giveback, scholarships and professional recognition, PR and marketing, and formalized male allyship. The security and safety market within the US alone has a growth trajectory attractive to diversified talents and perspectives. Women can and do thrive here. We simply need more of them.
                           
                            8. **We are very blessed that some very prominent names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them.**
                           
                            9. Hands down, it would be Dolly Parton. From humble Appalachian beginnings to becoming a "rockstar" at 77, she has and always will be Chief Executive Officer of "Me, Inc.". Dolly's style, beauty, and grace are backed by vocal talent and illustrious songwriting that broke every barrier within the music industry. Her jump to film was nothing short of spectacular as she could make you laugh (9 to 5) as much as cry (Steel Magnolias). She's a fashion icon and, by the way, a founder. Her Dollywood Co. includes a mega theme park and other entertainment ventures. She's written books and movies, scored Broadway musicals, has an array of merchandise, and most importantly — — — Dolly is a Go-Giver. Her non-profit Dollywood Foundation makes positive headlines yearly with her Imagination Library for Literacy, grants to offset natural disaster community impact, and more. She is a light, a force, and a rock star. Walking a day in her life's shadow would be an honor.
                           
                            10. **How can our readers further follow your work online?**
